import streamlit as st
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import altair as alt
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple

# 1) The VERY FIRST Streamlit command:
st.set_page_config(
    page_title="Operational Modal Analysis Tool",
    layout="wide"
)

# 2) Now you can define all your functions, imports, and classes
#    (these do not call Streamlit, so they are safe to define here).
#    ... your FDDAuto code, your SSI code, your perform_analysis, etc. ...

def FDDAuto(...):
    # your code
    pass

def generate_synthetic_data(...):
    # your code
    pass

def perform_analysis(...):
    # your code
    pass

# 3) Only after your code is defined, you can define your main() that uses Streamlit.
def main():
    # Now itâ€™s safe to do st.markdown() etc.
    st.title("Operational Modal Analysis Tool")

    # The rest of your Streamlit UI code
    # st.write(...)
    # st.slider(...)
    # st.button(...)
    # etc.

# 4) Finally, call main().
if __name__=="__main__":
    main()
